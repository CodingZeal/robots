# robots

This repo contains a solver for the [Ricochet Robots](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/51/ricochet-robots) game.

It is the basis for my talk at [Mountain West Ruby Conference 2015](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/).

This is under active development and is likely to change drastically as I prepare the talk.
I reserve the right to force push to this repo without notice, so clone at your own risk.

Once everything has stabilized, I'll maintain this repo in a much friendlier manner.
